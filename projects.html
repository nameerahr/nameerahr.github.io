                        of my undergraduate degree. Below you will also find the languages that I am familiar 
                        with and have used while working on my projects or during my past internships.

                    <h4> April 2024 </h4>
                    <p> Developed a multi-threaded audio processing application in C, utilizing libcurl for fetching audio data
                        from URLs provided by the Freesound API, libsndfile for audio file I/O, and pthreads for concurrency 
                        management. The program reads tasks from an input file, retrieves audio data, and applies the specified 
                        modifications (ex: reverse, half speed, double speed) before locally saving the processed audio files as .wav files.

                    <p> Created a dynamic web application to assist users in keeping track of their reading materials
                        such as books on their current list and completed books. The frontend was developed using HTML, 
                        CSS and JavaScript and the backend used Python, the Flask framework, as well as stored user 
                        libraries in an SQLite database. The application enables users to search for, add and 
                        organize their books.

                    <p> Designed and built a robot car with automatic and manual functionalities using C++ and 
                        Arduino Uno/Nano boards. When run on automatic mode, the robot can be line following or 
                        obstacle avoiding. When run on manual mode, the robot can be wirelessly controlled using 
                        a joystick controller via NRF2L01 transceiver modules.

                    <p> Developed a simulation of an online banking system using Java, that can be used in the 
                        terminal. Users are able to login to existing accounts or create new accounts. Inside 
                        an account, users can make transactions, view/edit account information and access 
                        credit accounts. User data and history is retrieved and stored in JSON files.

                    <p> Created a Sudoku game using Python. A GUI for the game was created with PyGame. Players 
                        must select a pen type, pencil or marker. They then have to select the location on the 
                        board for their entry. Entries in pencil are temporary but entries in marker are permanent. 
                        Players are free to switch between pen types.

                    <p> Built an interactive Morse Code game using C and an STM32 Nucleo Board. In the game, 
                        4 colours are communicated in a random sequence to the player in morse code. 
                        The player must translate the morse code message and press the correct colour buttons. 
                        They succeed if they enter the entire colour sequence correctly.

                        players. Allows players to input the desired location of their player piece on to a
