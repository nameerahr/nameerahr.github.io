                        of my undergraduate degree. Below you will also find the languages that I am familiar 
                        with and have used while working on my projects or during my past co-ops.

                    <h4> December 2022 </h4>
                    <p> Developed a simulation of an online banking system using Java, that can be used in the 
                        terminal. Users are able to login to existing accounts or create new accounts. Inside 
                        an account, users can make transactions, view/edit account information and access 
                        credit accounts. User data and history is retrieved and stored in JSON files.

                    <h4> October 2022 </h4>
                    <p> Created a Sudoku game using Python. A GUI for the game was created with PyGame. Players 
                        must select a pen type, pencil or marker. They then have to select the location on the 
                        board for their entry. Entries in pencil are temporary but entries in marker are permanent. 
                        Players are free to switch between pen types.

                    <p> Built an interactive Morse Code game using C and an STM32 Nucleo Board. In the game, 
                        4 colours are communicated in a random sequence to the player in morse code. 
                        The player must translate the morse code message and press the correct colour buttons. 
                        They succeed if they enter the entire colour sequence correctly.

                    <p> Developed a Tic Tac Toe game using Python, which can be played in a terminal with two 
                        players. Allows players to input the desired location of their player piece on to a 
                        board until a player wins or there is a tie.
