                    <h3> Morse Code Game </h3>
                    <h4> February 2022 </h4>
                    <p> Created an interactive Morse Code game using C and an STM32 Nucleo Board. In the game, 
                        4 colours are communicated in a random sequence to the player in morse code. 
                        The player must translate the morse code message and press the correct colour buttons. 
                        They succeed if they enter the entire colour sequence correctly.

                    <h4> August 2021 </h4>
                    <p> Developed a Tic Tac Toe game using Python, which can be played in a terminal with two 
                        players. Allows players to input the desired location of their player piece on to a 
                        board until a player wins or there is a tie.
